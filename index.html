	    <p>some ofSure thing! üëç Tesla's early life was marked by tragedy. His older brother died when Tesla was still a child, and his mother passed away when he was only 16. Despite these losses, Tesla was a gifted student and excelled in math and physics. After studying engineering in Europe, he moved to the United States in 1884 and began working for Thomas Edison. However, the two men had very different approaches to engineering, and Tesla eventually left Edison's company to pursue his own ideas. In 1887, Tesla developed the alternating current (AC) motor, which is still used in many applications today.
